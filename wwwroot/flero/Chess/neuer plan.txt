Calculation
K 1) Remove results from tomorrow onwards.
K 2) Calc until today
K 2b) Whenever competition is over, final prediction and set seeds for follow up.


3) maybe eliminate non-participants

5) Pick all future competitions, create fixtures with seeds only.

Simulate:
6) Whenever competition is over, set seed set for follow up.
